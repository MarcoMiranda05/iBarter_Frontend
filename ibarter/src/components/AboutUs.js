          <p>
            We are an app that connects people with the same interest: trade
            items. To use the iBarter is very simple and you just have to follow
            the simple no money involved rule.
          </p>

        <div>
          <p className="question">What do I need to place an offer?</p>
          <p>
            You will need to have at least one item listed as well. On iBarter
            you literally need to offer one item to trade for what you are
            looking for.
